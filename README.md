## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, the ability to effectively extract, manipulate, and analyze data is crucial. This repository aims to equip you with the skills to master both SQL and Python, two of the most powerful tools in a data analyst's arsenal. We'll explore how to use SQL for efficient data retrieval and how to seamlessly integrate it with Python for more complex data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## SQL Fundamentals

This section covers the core concepts of SQL, starting from basic queries to more advanced techniques.

### Basic Queries

Learn how to select data from tables, understand different data types, and use aliases.

- `SELECT` statement
- `FROM` clause
- Data types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.)
- Aliases (`AS`)

### Filtering and Sorting

Discover how to narrow down your results and order them logically.

- `WHERE` clause (operators: `=`, `>`, `<`,
